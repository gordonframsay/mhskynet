These are static players that require no server technology to function.  In fact, you don't even need a server 
at all!  All you need is an internet connection and a web browser.  Open the schedule page (youtube or html5, 
depending on the movie type), fill out the form and submit.  The only requirement is that the schedule and 
player files be in the same directory.

For HTML5 movies, you can even use a local file url (e.g. file:///Users/gordon/videos/mymovie.mp4 ), but of 
course you'll need to share the movie file with others, one way or another, if you want to watch it together.

Note that these files are configured for MH's forums by default.  You'll likely want to set those parameters 
to your own.  They are these lines near the top of the player files:

  var disqus_shortname = 'mhskynet';
  var disqus_identifier = 'youtube_static_screening_room_1';
  var disqus_url = 'http://www.mhsky.net/static_players/youtube_player.html';


See disqus.com for setting up your own (free) forums or how to leverage the forum account you may already have.

Have fun!
